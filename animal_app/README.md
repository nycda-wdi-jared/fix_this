# FIX ME PLEASE

1. Run the sql file in the main directory to a new database. All of the information (columns & data) should be added once you have done that. This site will help you: https://superuser.com/questions/701415/how-do-i-execute-run-a-sql-file-in-postgresql-9-2-6-centos

2. Go ahead and fix all of the errors in the application.

3. Create a new git repository to push up this code to. That is what you will be sending to me.

3. In the end, I want:
 	* Giphys to show up in 3 separate columns, 3 per column. One giphy for each animal in the database. 
 		* Columns are based on the animals class. 
 		* There are 3 separate animal classes in the database.
 	* For the application to run smoothly when I type in ```npm start```

4. Dont copy and paste code from previous projects
